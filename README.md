## The Ultimate Budget
Not your typical budget portfolio project. I am a personal follower of FIRE, and have been budgeting for nearly ten years, since I graduated college and entered the workforce. Using my decade of personal experience, and several test runs and templates in excel and google sheets, I applied my background in user experience to formulate the most comprehensive budgeting application.
