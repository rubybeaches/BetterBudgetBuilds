## The Ultimate Budget - (development in progress)
Not your typical budget portfolio project. I am a personal follower of FIRE, and have been budgeting for nearly ten years, since I graduated college and entered the workforce. Using my decade of personal experience, and several test runs and templates in excel and google sheets, I applied my background in user experience to formulate the most comprehensive budgeting application. It includes a budget calculator using demographic percentages for the US based on income, default template categories, a system for implementing recurring expenses and income, as well as in budget connections to savings goals such as for an emergency fund or yearly expenses like car insurance - baked into monthly and weekly expense planning...and more!
